# AI Decision-Making
## Utility and Rational Games
### Utility
This is how much benefit an agent can derive from the outcome. It can be considered a measure of the "welfare" that an agent gets. Thus, it is subjective and depends on the aims of the agent.

We might not have full information on the actions of others, so what we believe about their objectives affects how accurately we can strategise.

Assuming that an opponent will act with perfect rationality means we can choose actions that should lead to a good outcome even if they do not.

By calculating utility, can avoid bluff and double bluff if done accurately.

### The Prisoner's Dilemma
```
"Suppose that the police have arrested two people whom they know have committed an armed robbery together. Unfortunately, they lack enough admissible evidence to get a jury to convict. They do, however, have enough evidence to send each prisoner away for two years for theft of the getaway car. The chief inspector now
makes the following offer to each prisoner: If you will confess to the robbery, implicating your partner, and she does not also confess, then you’ll go free and she’ll get ten years. If you both confess, you’ll each get 5 years. If neither of you confess, then you’ll each get two years for the auto theft."
```

Wherever one action for a player is superior to her other actions for each possible action by the opponent, we say that  
the first action strictly dominates the second one. In the Dilemma, then, confessing strictly dominates refusing for both  
players. Both players know this about each other, thus entirely eliminating any temptation to depart from the strictly  
dominated path. Thus both players will confess, and both will go to prison for 5 years.
### Game Trees
We can model a game with a tree, even if it is not strictly sequential.
### Solutions
"Zero sum" games is when the total payoffs add up to zero - There is only one loser and one winner.

A "solved" game is considered to have reached a state of "equilibrium" - it is stable unless an external force changes something.

"Nash Equilibrium" occurs when the strategies cannot be improved given the decisions of the other players.
## Stackelberg Security Games
Designed to deal with adversarial situations where the 2nd player chooses an action after observing the first player's action.
