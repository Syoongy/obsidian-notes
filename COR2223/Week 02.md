# Agents
## Rational
- Restricted to their purpose
- Specialised AI (Performs only their given task)
- Able to perceive and act on their "world" (the problem they are to solve)
- Decision-making method and use of learning enhancement depends on its environment
# Machine Learning
Subfield of AI where deep learning is a technique within machine learning.
- Any part of an AI system can be potentially improved by machine learning. We take observations of the data to improve the model.
- We need to consider whether the system we are improving starts from 0 or already has prior knowledge
- Useful when we have enough data to establish patterns and trends to form a working hypotheses
## Classical AI: Deductive Reasoning
Before ML became widely possible, AI systems were pre-programmed with facts and relationship. They produced deductions based on logical reasoning.

We start with a general theory, observe a fact, and draw a conclusion. If both theory and fact are consistent, the conclusion must be valid.
## Inductive Reasoning
Start with a set of observed facts and derive a theory that is consistent with them. The more facts observed that support the theory, the stronger confidence we have in it.
