# What is a computer system?
## Hardware/Software split
- Software: algorithms, programs
- Processors, hard drives
One is a direction the other is the tool to drive
## Levels of Abstraction
Describes the behaviour of a system at different levels of specificity
- Intention (What is it supposed to do)
- Specification (The requirements)
- Algorithm (How it is going to do the job)
- Programming language instructions
- Assembly/Machine Code Operations
- Execution
Everything a computer does is a sequence of mathematical calculations
# Where did Modern Computing come from?
- Alan Turing - Can you tell if a puzzle is solvable before you solve it?
	- Designed the idea of the turing machine - a computational device that could calculate anything that could be calculated
- Stored Program Concept - EDVAC(1945)
	- Computers should store the program and data on the same memory
	- Treat instructions as data - Made high level programming languages possible
- The first computer "system" - IBM 1401 (1959)
	- IBM developed programs to save clients programming for themselves - software suites
- Shrinking - Minicomputers and Semiconductors (1965)
	- "Moores law"
	- Semiconductors allowed for creation of smaller circuits
- Personal Computer (1976)
	- Steve Jobs and Mike Wozniak developed the Apple II - A Desktop computer for general purpose computing
	- IBM and Mircosoft joined forces to develop the industry standard. Combining Microsoft's OS with IBM's hardware.
- The Internet and World Wide Web (1994)
	- Began with the US military ARPAnet in the 60s
	- CERN developed hypertext - access documents on remote computers via a central link, allowing storage to be distributed
	- Foundation of the World Wide Web and paved the way for greater distribution of resources leading to the cloud
- Mobile Computing (2007)
	- In accordance with Moore's Law, computing power increased yet became more portable with production of laptops surpassing desktops in 2008
	- The IPhone released in 2007 was not the first smartphone but kickstarted the smartphone revolution
- Web 2.0, Big Data, Cloud and the AI revolution (2004-now)
	- Supported user-generated content and interaction on the Web
	- Basis of the Cloud - Remotely accessed computing power that was rented. Full circle to the old days of mainframe computers - but now with data centres access over the internet
	- This connectivity and access to computer power enabled machine learning to take off and triggerring the new AI revolution
# What is Artificial Intelligence?
## What do we want to achieve?
We have 4 directions that we have split our focus on
![[wk1_ai_01.png]]
## General direction of modern AI
We are generally treating them as "Beneficial machines".
### To pass the Turing Test, an AI needs:
- NLP
- Knowledge Representation
- Automated Reasoning
- Machine learning
- Computer Vision (Total test only)
- Robotics (Total test only)
Rather than imitating human behaviour, we can apply them to problem-solving. (Is a plane flying successfully, or having it do so by flapping its wings like a bird more important?)

A "rational agent" would do the _right thing_ based on a combination of logic and probability in rational thought but in complex and time-limited situations, it may not be possible to properly compute true rationality.

We need the exact objective for rational thought. However, a rigid and simplistic objective can have consequences.

# Difference between AI and a regular computer program
Computer programs run algorithms.
An AI based approach would run many simulations based on the parameters and work towards the best outcome.
