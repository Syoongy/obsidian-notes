# Definition
This view comes from _Immanuel Kant's_ view of ethics. He was sceptical about grounding ethical conduct on happiness which he considers to be empiricism, senses and inclinations. Furthermore, his world-view rested on pure reason as he believed that each person possesses autonomy and freedom to act. A rational person possesses autonomy and freedom to act. A rational person possesses understanding and seeks to **exercise his or her will based on reason**, **free from impulses and senses**. He endorsed the concept of good will, which he regarded as an “end in itself”.
Kant's ethics is usually described as deontological (which is based on moral duties).

----
## Moral Actor
Acts based on their moral **duty** and not from impulses, inclinations and sense. These rules are called categorical imperatives.

## Categorical Imperatives
### Principle of Universality
- the maxims you live by must be maxims that you can will as becoming universal law

### Principle of Humanity
- you must act in ways that treat people only as ENDS and not MEANS

## Moral Duties
Derived from these 2 imperatives are 4 specific duties
- No suicide (person = means)
- No false promises (causes distrust, lender treated as a means)
- Develop one's talents and capacities (A rational person would will this, advance humanity as an end in itself)
- Show benevolence towards others (everyone needs help)
