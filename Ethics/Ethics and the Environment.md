## Why should we protect the environment?
### Why is it difficult to convince people to protect the environment?
- Poorer countries have more pressing issues to address
- Economic loss is possible when protecting the environment
- It is inconvenient
- It is harder to envision long term issues

----
## How do the ethical theories target this issue?
- ### [[Utilitarianism]]
	- Environmental change can affect a majority of people with rising temperatures and sea levels
- ### [[Kantian]]
	- "Do not do unto others what you would not want done to yourself"
	- Even if we are not directly suffering from environmental change, it may badly affect others
- ### [[Virtue Ethics]]
	- The golden mean implies that we should keep the environment in a balance
	- Distributive justice, the sharing of resources should be equal amongst all
	- Compensatory justice, we should compensate those who live in lands which are affected by environmental change (Deforested areas, areas where other countries have benefited through mining etc)
	- Retributive justice
- ### [[Moral Relativism]]
	- Poorer countries might deem it unnecessary to protect the environment in favour of economic growth
- ### [[Robert Nozick, The Entitlement Theory|The Entitlement Theory]]
	- Are we entitled to taker resources from other lands

## Who should protect the environment
### Businesses
### 1. Classical Theory
Businesses have no corporate social responsibility, and should be judged on purely economic terms. Left alone, business activity will secure societal wellbeing.
- In reality, this is unlikely. Businesses are for-profit organisations and would tend to make decisions to benefit the company itself rather than the environment.
- Companies could possibly target environmentally conscious consumers and have reason to protect the environment
- Could cause greenwashing to gain more profit through low effort means

### 2. Neo-classical Theory
There is a moral minimum that businesses should abide by.
#### Norman Bowie (Minimalist)
- Businesses should abide by the law as the minimum and the remaining responsibility should be held by individuals
#### Higher floors enacted by others
There are those who argue that "avoiding harm", fulfilling the social contract with society, fulfilling responsibilities towards stakeholders, or respecting the moral rights of employees/consumers.

### 3. Stakeholder Theory
Corporations should benefit all who have a _stake_ in the enterprise and not just for profit maximisation of stockholders. This is to the extent that any stakeholders' concerns for the environment is an obligation by the company to take note of.
There is also a case where businesses are to treat stakeholders in its own right.

### Individuals
- Sustainable consumption (buying slow fashion, reusable/second-hand items, cutting down on consumption)
- No-waste lifestyle
- No eating meat

Are individuals all obliged to protect the environment?
The Pareto principle implies 80% of the environmental would come from 20% of the people. Thus, are the other 80% of the world obliged to also protect the environment?

### States
Why do states have moral obligations to their citizens?
They should lead their citizens to be morally right.
Developing states may be reluctant in giving up coal and fossil fuel production.
States are the primary caretakers of their citizens. However, this is not the case for the state of Tuvalu, where 2 of its 9 islands are almost underwater. This turns climate change into a transnational problem where one country can affect another.
