# Definition
Aristotle proposed that 'Just' means lawful and fair. Justice is complete virtue and that
which leads to someone else's good, not merely oneself, Aristotle examined three forms
of justice, namely distributive, compensatory and retributive justice.

---------
## Distributive Justice
Examines the benefits and advantages accrued from one person to the next. This involves distribution of goods in accordance with the right proportions.

## Rectificatory or Compensatory Justice
Compensation of wrongs done upon the victim. Aims to restore the victim to the original position prior to the wrongdoing.

## Retributive Justice
To punish the wrongdoer and achieve the same moral equilibrium as compensatory justice.
