# Definition
Objective was to select **rules of justice** applicable for a “well-ordered society” in which rules are generally complied with. It is not primarily concerned with individual moral action by societal rules of conduct.

Men are self-interested and rational, free to act and equal.

-----
Social contracts are set in the Original Position - We are all free and equal persons who **agree** and **commit** ourselves to the idea of justice

As a self-interested and rational individual, one plans to obtain available social goods (rights liberties, opportunities, income and wealth) via the most effective means possible (max level, best plan)

Society (branches of government) must decide on grounds of fairness, under a “veil of ignorance”. This is because the rational self-interested actor in the Original Position does not know what his competitors are like, and hence would not make self-serving decisions to his own benefit.

## Principle of Justice/Equal Liberty
Each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive total system of basic liberties, compatible with a similar system of liberty for all. Liberties cannot be traded for socioeconomic advantages.

## Socioeconomic inequalities
social and economic inequality should be arranged to 
	(a) the greatest benefit of the least advantaged, “the Difference principle”.
	(b) attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity “fair equality of opportunity principle”.

## Amartya Sen's views
They believe the focus should be on social realisations i.e. the actual behaviour of people, and the comparison of these social realisations.
