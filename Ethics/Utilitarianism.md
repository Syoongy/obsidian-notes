# Definition
It is a theory based on outcomes. The theory is premised on the principle that an action is right and should be performed as it will lead to overall happiness or benefits, as opposed to pain or costs.
The moral actor makes the decision based on the likely consequences of an action.

------
_John Stuart Mill_ argues how utilitrianism is "**right**" in proportion to the promotion of happiness and "**wrong**" in how they promote the reverse of happiness. He defines "happiness" as intended pleasure and absence of pain; "Unhappiness" as pain and privation of pleasure. There is no other evidence to prove that happiness is good.

He thus advocates for the **Greatest Happiness Principle** to consider the overall happiness of the decision.

## Happiness value
For this principle, we need a way to calculate happiness.
### Determining value
Jeremy Bentham who influened Mill came up with the following factors to determine happiness value:
- Intensity of the pleasure
- Duration of the pleasure
- Certainty that the pleasure will materialise
- Remoteness of the pleasure sought
- Repeatability of the pleasure
- Purity of the pleasure (i.e., Whether it will be accompanied by pain)
- Extent (i.e., Number of people affected by the pleasure)

### Higher and lower pleasures
Mill however, did not agree that it was only determined by these factors. He argues how there are higher and lower pleasures where some pleasures are more valuable than others. Therefore, a higher pleasure cannot be exchanged for a lower one. He also regards humans such as _Socrates_ as those capable of experiencing higher pleasures ("_Better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied_").
A novice in making decisions should be advised from "competent judges" with experience of both pleasures to determine the level of said pleasure.

### Why should I follow GHP?
Mill believes that the decision maker may experience attacks on his conscience and remorse for immoral actions. This may be further reinforced with external sanctions in the form of disfavour or displeasure from fellow creatures or _God_.

## Problems
### Ignoring the minority
This problem arises from the great focus on the happiness of the majority and ignores the rights of the minority.

## Types
### Act Utilitarianism
Focuses on the consequences of an individual act to maximise overall happiness.

### Rule Utilitarianism
Focuses on consequences coming from adopting a general rule, instead of a particular action.
