# What is advertising?
A form of **mass** communication containing information regarding a commerical product. It brings an element of _choice_ to the consumer

## Moral Justification
When looking at advertising through [[Utilitarianism] Utilitarian] and [[Kantian]] ethics, we can argue that advertising provides information to willing consumers and facilitates transactions in the marketplace that are presumably in the interests of the buyer and seller.

However, when looking through a consequentialist lens (e.g. [[Utilitarianism] utilitarian] framework) towards advertising, We can say that it can cause buyers to buy things they do not need and consequentially lose money.

A similar argument can be made when adopting a deontological lens (e.g. the framework of [[[Kantian]] ethics) we can argue how advertising breaks the principles of humanity by treating people as a means of earning money.

## Ethically Contentious Aspects of Advertising
### A) Advertising to vulnerable persons
George G Brenkert says that there are 4 types of consumer vulnerabilities
- Physical
- Cognitive
- Motivational
- Social
He argues that it is morally wrong to market goods to vulnerable people where their vulnerabilities are due to factors beyond their control. He further states that their vulnerabilities render them more susceptible to harm compared to other consumers.

### B) Advertising Socially Undesirable Products
Smoking/Drinking/etc advertisements. Basically advertising vices.
With the Marlboro advertisement, the "Be Marlboro" slogan sold itself as an identity/culture/lifestyle.

### C) Deceptive Advertising
Photoshopping models on advertisements, using deceptive statements like being able to "Wake up to visibly repaired skin. As if you had slept 2 extra hours"

### D) Personalised Advertising
Very pervasive because it targets the consumer directly.

### E) Promotion Strategies
This includes:
- Unrealistic or untrue claims about the product or conditions of the sale (e.g. "Sale for 3 days only")
- Direct marketing to professionals (e.g. sample drugs given to doctors)
- Direct marketing which may be intrusive and time-consuming (e.g. marketing calls)
