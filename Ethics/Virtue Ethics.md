# Definition
This school of thought comes from _Aristotle,_ where virtue is a purposive disposition, lying in a mean relative to us and determined by a rational principle. He considers happiness a good in itself where it is not derived from pleasure or pain, but on one's virtuous activities.
Some of these virtues are as follows 
- **justice** (a complete virtue which leads to good)
- **liberality** (virtuous attitude towards money)
- **patience** (virtuous response to minor provocation)
- **amiability** (virtue of personal persona)
- **truthfulness, magnanimity, indifference**(to recognition)
- **wittiness**
These are followed by 3 concepts

## Concepts
### Disposition (Hexis)
Ethical virtue is a disposition/tendency, induced by our habits, to have appropriate feelings.
### Doctrine of voluntary choice (purposive)
Must not be ignorant of circumstances and objectives, such that he suffers subsequent pain and remorse, AND must not be compelled by external causes only such that he contributes nothing to the act.
### Doctrine of the (golden) mean
 every ethical virtue is an INTERMEDIATE CONDITION between EXCESS and DEFICIENCY. However, this does not mean that you never have strong feelings â€“ just in moderation, only when called for. (How do we determine this?)

## Robert Solomon
He attempts to apply these concepts in business ethics and determined six parameters.
- Community: Corporation as a member of larger community
- Excellence: Merit, not mediocrity
- Membership
- Integrity
- Judgment
- Holism (stakeholders, not stockholders)
