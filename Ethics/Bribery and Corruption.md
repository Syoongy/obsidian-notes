# Definition
Misuse of power/position/office for personal gains. Bribery is a major example of corruption

----
## Reasons for corruption
- Low public-sector salaries
- Immunity of public officials
- Secrecy in government
- Worsening public procurement practices
- Privatisation process
- Increase in foreign investment and trade
- Restrictions on the media
- Financial liberalisation
- Multiparty elections

### How bribery and corruption become endemic
- Lack of transparency and information channels to expose corrupt practices
- Poor regulations to stop corruption and bribery
- Public officials feel that they can get away with OR need to resort to corruption to make a living
- Powerful private individuals/organisations continue to enable bribery and corruption
- Less powerful individuals/ organisations are not able to end the cycle of corruption OR speak up about it

## Corrupt Societies
We describe widespread corruption in a country/society as **kleptocracy** - toxic to human dignity, good governance, and democracy.

The **resource curse** is faced by resource-rich countries in the developing world, which often face high levels of corruption and endemic poverty. States have monopoly rights over the resources and corrupt officials are incentivised to exchange mining rights to private contractors for part of the revenue.

**Mega-corruption** is when the ruling elite are part of the corruption in their societies. This is usually accompanied by suppression of personal freedoms and civic liberties. (Wanting to hold onto power)

## Why this concerns companies
Multi-nation corporations (MNCs) operate in the at a global scale due to the state of our economy. These companies may have branches/manufacturing bases/consumer markets in various other nations.

### To what extent should MNCs be willing to encourage and participate in corrupt practices?
- Many companies can lose their edge/advantage over other companies who do participate in corrupt practices
- Deprives more qualified companies from the opportunity to operate in the area

### Grease Payments
Does not engineer outcomes. Speeds up/eases the way to the outcome that the payer was entitled to. (e.g. getting a passport renewed faster)

### Guanxi
Relying on social interactions and customs as well as social networking. (Nepotism)

## Current solutions
- Anti-corruptions laws and enforcement (Corruption investigation bureaus/organisations in Singapore and Hong Kong)
- International efforts (UN Convention against Corruption)
There needs to be more effective punishments targeted towards the company rather than individuals. Bigger punishments that are not seen as a "slap on the wrist".
