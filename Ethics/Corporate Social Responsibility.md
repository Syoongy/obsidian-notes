## Theoretical Perspectives
### Investor-based Perspective
Championed by Milton Friedman: American economist and Nobel  
Laureate, neoclassical economist and libertarian in his political  
views.
"Only people, not business, have responsibilities. There should be freedom from excessive state intervention: 'Businessmen who talk this way are unwitting puppets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining the basis of a free society these past decades.' "
#### First Argument
"In a free‐enterprise, private‐property system, a **corporate executive** is an employee of the owners of the business. He has **direct responsibility** to his employers. That responsibility is to **conduct the business in accordance with their desires**, which **_generally will be to make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules_** of the society, both those embodied in law and those embodied in ethical custom."

#### Second Argument
"The stockholders or the customers or the employees could separately spend their own money on the particular action if they wished to do so."
If the executive exercises a distinct “social responsibility” (i.e., by spending money differently from how the stockholders/customers/employees would have spent it: ”he is in effect imposing taxes, on the one hand, and deciding how the tax proceeds shall be spent, on the other.”

#### Third Argument
##### Free market/Economic Principle: Unanimity
- In an ideal free market resting on private property, no individual can coerce any other, all cooperation is voluntary, all parties to such cooperation benefit, or they need not participate. There are no “social” values, no “social” responsibilities in any sense other than the shared values and responsibilities of individuals.
##### Political Principle: Conformity
- The political principle that underlies the political mechanism is conformity. The individual may have a vote and a say in what is to be done, but if he is overruled, he must conform. It is appropriate for some to require others to contribute to a general social purpose, whether they wish to or not.

Friedman is NOT saying that businesses have an unfettered licence to act immorally - but that the socially responsible thing for them to do is to make profits.
The freedom to make money is what benefits the whole economy.

### Stakeholder-Based Perspective
Advocated by John Mackey, CEO and founder of Whole Foods Market.
- "Friedman is thinking only in terms of maximizing profits for the investors... In contrast to Friedman, I do not believe maximising profits for the investors is the only acceptable justification for all corporate actions. The investors are not the only people who matter. Corporations can exist for purposes other than simply maximising profits."
- "I believe the entrepreneurs, not the current investors in a company’s stock, have the right and responsibility to define the purpose of the company"
