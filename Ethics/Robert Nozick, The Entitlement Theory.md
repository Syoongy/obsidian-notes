# Definition
Nozick is a firm advocate of the free market. Nozick’s theory of entitlement states that each person should be able to pursue his/her own interests with minimal governmental intervention. Any state more extensive violates people’s rights.

He pursues this with 3 principles

-----
## Principle of Just Original Acquisition
If you had acquired it justly

## Principle of Just Transfer
If you transfer the justly acquired item

## Principle of Rectification
To correct unjust appropriations by fraud and force

The ideal situation would be where the acquisition of property by X is just and thus the transfer of the property to Y would also be just. This is violated when someone has stolen property, forcibly obtained or cheated people.

-----
This theory also takes into account historical events. If a piece of land has been unjustly acquired, rectification can be applied. However, how far can we look back into the past? If a piece of land was acquired unjustly hundreds of years ago and has been justly traded since, do we compensate descendants of those who were treated unjustly.

## Ethical Egoism
Emphasises the open and free competition under the free market theory. In contrast, this exploits the working class.
