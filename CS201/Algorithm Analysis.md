# How to determine a good algorithm
## Is it correct?
- Tests
- Proofs
## Is it efficient?
- Experiments
- Analyses

## Measuring Performance
### Empirically
- Implementation must be available
- Hardware and software environments must be controlled
- Experiments can only be done over limited set of inputs

### Analytically
- Avoid having to implement first
- Independent of hardware and software
- Accounts for all inputs

## What do we count?
### Primitive operations
Assigning values to variables, performing operations, comparisons, accessing arrays, etcâ€¦
The cost of this depends on the operation. Can range from n(1) for assigning to larger costs for methods like `.contains()

## Counting
Usage of product and sum rule or permutations and combinations.
