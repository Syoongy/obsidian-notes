## Recursive
- If a tree is non-empty, it has a node called root with no parent
- Each child (if any) of that root is in turn the root of another sub-tree

## Ordered vs. Unordered
- In an ordered tree, there is a meaningful ordering of the children of each node
- Otherwise, the tree is unordered

## Binary Search Tree (BST)
### Recursive Definition
- Non-empty BST has a root
- Each child (if any) of the root is the root of another binary search sub-tree
- All elements in the left sub-tree are smaller than the root
- All elements in the right sub-tree are larger than the root
