# Definition
This is a tight bound concept, mapping positive integers to real positive numbers. It can be akin to taking both lower and upper bounds.

We say f(n) is $$\theta(g(n))$$
if there exists real constants $$c',c''>0$$ and integer constant $$n_0>=1$$ for which the following holds:
## $$c'.g(n) <= f(n) <= c''.g(n) \space for \space n>=n_0$$
