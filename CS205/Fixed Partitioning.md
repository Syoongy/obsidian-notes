### Fixed Partitioning
![[fixed_partitioning_1.png]]![[fixed_partitioning_2.png]]
- Can be equal/unequal size partitioning
- Simple to implement and little OS overhead
- Memory utilisation is inefficient - any program, regardless of size, occupies an entire partition
- Internal fragmentation - wasted space due to the block of data loaded being smaller than the partition
#### Memory
