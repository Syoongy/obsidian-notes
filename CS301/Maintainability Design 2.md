# What is Maintainability?
- Modularity
	- Change to a component has minimal impact to others
- Reusability
	- Can be used in more than one system
- Analysability
	- Assess the impact on a product or system of an intended change
- Modifiability
	- Modified without introducing defects or degrading existing product quality
- Testability
	- Determine whether those criteria been met
## Considerations
- Software Coding
	- Coding Guidelines
- Software Design and Development
	- Object-oriented Design
	- Design Principles and Patterns
	- Development Strategy
- Solution Architecture
	- Integration patterns
	- Architecture Styles
# S.O.L.I.D Design Principles
- Single Responsibility
	- A class should have one, and only one, reason to change
- Open Closed 
	- You should be able to extend a class's behaviour, without modifying it
- Liskov Substitution
	- Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes
- Interface Segregation
	- Make fine-grained interfaces that are client specific
- Dependency Inversion
	- Depend on abstractions and not on concrete implementations
