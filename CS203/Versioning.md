# Types
There are 2 main types of versioning, centralised and distributed.

-----
## Centralised versioning
An example of this type of versioning would be Subversion. This type of versioning uses a master server and each copy needs to talk to the master before commiting code.

## Distributed versioning
An example of this would be [[Git]] or Mercurial. All repos in this type of versioning can have the same role where the team can designate a "cental" repo (e.g. Github repo).
