# What is SCRUM?
It is an AGILE style of managing a project.
It does not provide specific solutions. Instead, it makes typical problems of software development more visible.

--------
## Roles
- Product owner: Has a vision of what to build
- Team: To develop the product
- SCRUM master: Facilitate the process

-------
## Lifecycle

### Kickoff/Sprint planning
- Each project begins with a kickoff meeting
- A meeting taks place before each sprint

### Backlog
- List of all product features generally defined by “user stories”
- [[User Story]]

### Estimation
- How long a user story would take
- Accurate estimation is hard
	- Agile uses relative estimation
- Stories ranked on a 1, 2, 3 point scale or Fibonacci scale
	- Estimates get larger the less we know about them
- Sprint velocity measured by points completed each sprint
- Can use planning poker game

### Definitions
- Epic: A collection of related stories
- Story: A user feature
- Task: Development tasks to accomplish the user story

### Daily Standup
- Short 15m meeting at the start of the day
- 3 questions:
	- What did you do yesterday?
	- What are you going to do today
	- Do you need help/Any blockers?
- Only sharing of progress
- Improves communication
- Identify impediments to development
- Promotes quick decision-making
- Improve team's level of knowledge

### Tracking
- Team members to update estimates of remaining time for tasks
- If burndown line is not tracking towards completion mid-sprint
	- Remove impediments
	- Get help
	- Reduce scope or abort sprint

### Sprint Velocity
Velocity in agile development measures the quantity of work a team can accomplish in a sprint. It can be measured in story points, hours or ideal days.

### Sprint Review
- Done at the end of each sprint
- Invite users for demo
- Discussion for backlog prioritsation
- Planning of next sprint
