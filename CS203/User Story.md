# What is it?
- Define things users want from your product
	- type of user: who is this for?
	- do this thing: what’s the intention?
	- accomplish this goal: what’s the benefit?
- Group related stories into epics
- They emphasize **verbal communication**
- Can be understood by both **users and developers**
- Can be used for **planning iterations** (sprints)
- Works well in **iterative** development
- Encourages **deferring of details**

### Adding user story details
- Details should not be added far ahead as details can be innacurate
- All questions need to be addressed before a story is completed. They do not need to be answered before the story is started

### How to add details to user story
- Break down large stories into smaller ones (e.g _“User can search for jobs” – how to break down?_)
- Add description and attachments to the story
- Add acceptence criteria/tests
- We can use the following methods:
	- User interviews
		- Ask open ended questions
	- Questionnaires
	- Observation
	- Story writing workshops
		- Meeting for all parties to write stories
